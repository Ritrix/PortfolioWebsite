                                I have been working here since May 2025. Here I am a Systems Analyst, and I build
                                websites and features used on in house web apps. I've worked with many insdustry
                                standard technologies here, such as using Figma to take a designers
                                work and make it real. Here we use ASP.NET core and .NET framework to build these
                                websites and API's. Here I would use SQL server for database management and would deploy
                                the web apps using Azure DevOps.
                            </p>

                                I've worked on many projects here, such as a website to monitor the statistics of
                                certain in house systems. as a result ive gained a lot of experience here with web
                                development, having now used libraries like Kendo UI
                                and bootstrap (What this website also uses!). I've also worked on API's and have
                                experience now using Unity professionally after taking over as the developer of a Unity
                                AR application.

                                I worked at Stryker for 4 years from June 2021 to May 2025. Here I worked as an
                                Associate Engineer,
                                where I helped develop and maintain the test systems we would use to test
                                defibrillators. I originally got a job here as a placement student, but moved onto full
                                time after I had finished my course in 2023. I worked on many different projects from
                                scripting tests, writing unit
                                tests, to designing and maintaining DLLs that were used to communicate with the
                                different pieces of hardware inside the test systems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At Stryker I worked on C# projects, and did a lot of documentation for these projects
                                from system assessment forms and verification protocols to system requirements and
                                design specifications. I also worked with python to develop scripts for data processing,
                                I worked on arduino microcontrollers and I wrote batch scripts to automate various
                                processes. I was also in charge of the calibration of the equipment used on site.

                                We all have to start somewhere, right? Well this is where I first started working a job.
                                I worked here for about 8 months before moving to Stryker from October 2020 to May 2021.

                                I got a job here while still studying at university over the Covid-19 period. I worked
                                as a cashier, pizza maker, cleaner, etc. I would list off all the skills I learned here
                                such as teamwork and time management, but really, the main reason I'm mentioning it here
                                is to show my roots. While my time there was relatively short, I appreciated it all the
                                same, which is why I still have the cap even all this time after.

                                Over the years I've garnered many technical skills, with that in mind I've decided to

                                as leaving out libraries or framework specific skills such as Kendo UI, Bootstrap,
                                pandas, etc.

                            <h3>Transferrable skills</h3>
                            <p>
                                I have also aquired many transferrable skills as well. Throughout my career I have
                                become quite good at debugging and problem solving. Much of my day to day for the last
                                few years has been creating and mainting software long term, and with much of my time
                                also being spent working on hardware too I have become quite adept at fixing issues, or
                                even spotting them before they become an issue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having spent so much of my time now on websites and games where UX (user experience) is
                                a key part, I believe I have become very well versed in the best practices towards
                                building intuitive and easy to use UI. This website for example, I believe showcases my
                                skills in UX well
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My teamwork skills are excellent, having now collaborated many times on a multitude of
                                projects. from game jams, to hackathons, and even just working with collegues I feel I
                                have ammassed a plethora of skills that I believe makes me a great team player. I have
                                also led many of these projects as team leader, and as such my leadership skills are
                                good too.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My testing and QA skills are quite good, as I spent much of my time at Stryker working
                                on test systems, which they themselves required rigorous testing to ensure no faults
                                would arise while testing a defibrillator. I have worked on unit testing, black-box and
                                white-box testing. And of course, testing in production (I have been informed that I
                                must put a disclaimer: I do not test in production - not intentionally at least!).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of my greatest skills, at least in my opinion, is my adaptability. I like to think
                                of myself as a jack of all trades as I have become familiar with many different aspects
                                of both software and hardware. Having now worked on back end web development, front end,
                                Databases, DLLs, scripting, game development, Windows applications, Android applications
                                PCB's/Circuitry, and much more, I feel confident in any role.
