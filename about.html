                                are equally so. I was born

                            <p>I've always had an interest in technology, and my
                                passion
                                lies in all things functional and creative. As a kid, I'd play with LEGO, K'NEX and
                                Meccano, and would often make things out of paper and tape. I'd spend far longer than
                                I'd like to admit here, toiling away at creating things that never worked as physics was
                                rarely on my side. I'd build swords and shields
                                out of paper, and battle with them, though they almost never lasted long.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I did get good
                                at it though, and ended up making guns out of paper, hot glue and elastic bands. I made
                                crossbows that could shoot grappling hooks, powerful semi automatic weapons, stuff that
                                really would sting if it hit you. You'd think with that I'd be gunning for a position at
                                Lockheed Martin, but unfortunately for young me at the time, they don't hire child
                                prodigies.

                            <p>However, I soon found my true calling: Computers. Even before I got my first computer, I
                                had played video games and could only dream of making my own (subtle foreshadowing). We
                                had a family computer that was awful, even at 5 years old I knew it was junk, but it was
                                all I had to complete my primary school assignments, so I got used to it. Eventually,
                                however, my school introduced me to a new program, known as scratch. With this program I
                                could create my own games, think of the possibilities! And that's about as far as I got
                                with it in primary school, was just thinking of the possibilities. I did end up
                                producing a few things with it, but they were terrible, even at the time I thought they
                                were bad. I still have some, which you can view deeply buried in the projects page. Even
                                with Scratch's simplicity I was still dumbfounded as a child, though I did get a second
                                chance to use it in secondary school, and that's where my real journey began.
                            </p>
                            <p>Once I had been re-introduced to it a few years into my secondary school education I
                                immediately fell in love with it and programming. It doesnt hurt that I also fell in
                                love with Minecraft and some of the fantastic mods for it like computer craft, which
                                lets you code a little robot buddy in Lua in the game. But back to Scratch, I ended up
                                making a ton of games with it around this time, some of which you can view in the
                                projects page! I made space shooters, zombie survival games, 2D platformers, anything
                                and everything I could imagine. I ended up using the software so much, that when it came
                                time to make games as an actual module in ICT, I submitted two fully completed
                                coursework assignments, instead of just one.

                            <p>While I spent a good chunk of my secondary school education on the software side of
                                things, that's only really half the story. As when I joined I took on a technology and
                                design class, and instantly fell in love with circuitry and hardware. I loved soldering
                                and creating my own PCB's. I ended up doing it for both my GCSE's and A-Levels where
                                I made a rudimentary radio transmitter and fan, which would turn on a fan when the
                                temperature around it got too hot, and send a signal to a radio receiver which would
                                turn on a light.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was meant for use inside a vehicle, in case you left a pet inside,
                                It wasn't very good though as the fan was way too low power to do anything and the
                                distance the signal could travel was laughably short. Even so, I still have a keen
                                interest in this side of things, which you can probably tell by the picture of my
                                current workstation on the left.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With this new interest in both software and hardware it was only inevitable that I'd
                                eventually build my own pc to replace my aging laptop, and at around 16 years old I did
                                exactly that. Goodbye crap-top, and hello to a new world of ultra fast computing! Okay
                                it wasn't <span class="font-italic">that</span> fast, it only had an AMD A8-7600 APU,
                                which even for the time was fairly
                                sluggish. But it was mine, and it was enough to start my journey in computing. It's even
                                still running today as I used it to build my parents PC, which is still going strong,
                                not bad for a decade old APU. It wasn't long before I upgraded this thing though, and
                                ended up with an Intel I5-7400 and GTX 1060. Nowadays I'm running far more powerful
                                hardware than even that, but as they say, you always remember your first.

                            <p>At A-Levels, I took on a Software Systems course and learned my first real programming
                                language: C#. I was tasked with building an application to login and store some data,
                                and this is where I really fell in love with programming. Everything I had learned and
                                loved up until this very point all coming together. All my programming experience,
                                hardware experience, problem solving, creativity, everything! All finally converging on
                                this one single course... I got a D.
                            </p>
                            <p>Yep, a solid D. It's not far off a failure, and most would even consider it to be one.
                                Though I
                                cant exactly completely blame myself for this. The school I attended wasn't the most up
                                to date, and i had to apply to this course outside of my school since they didn't have
                                the facilities to actually teach a programming course like this. This unfortunately
                                meant I ended up being dropped into the deep end of things, with my only experience
                                beforehand being moving Scratch blocks around. As for my other course though, I got a C
                                in Technology and Design, and a B in Business studies... Yeah I got no excuse for those.

                                It was a wet day in a tent on a camping holiday when I got the bad news: I had been
                                rejected from every University I had applied to. And as if things couldn't get worse,
                                the
                                weather that day was so bad it left a pool at the bottom of our tent, where my newly
                                acquired Nintendo Switch got submerged and destroyed. Overall, 0/10, would not recommend
                                that campsite.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That morning it felt like the world was ending, I shrivelled up in my sleeping bag, not
                                concerned that my electronics were submerged, wallowing in self pity for hours. It was
                                then that, for whatever reason, I decided to for probably the first time in years to
                                check my emails. That's when I saw it, an email from Ulster University - they had a
                                bridging course for those who didn't quite make the cut, pass it and you get in - and I
                                was invited.

                                    The course was for both engineers and software students, so it had a mish mash of
                                    engineering and programming modules. The programming ones were simple, like making a
                                    robot move with some basic commands they teach you on the day. One of the modules
                                    however, was to design and build a bridge out of only paper and masking tape, Just
                                    like I had done as a kid! It was one of the engineering tasks, you were graded on
                                    how heavy the bridge was compared to how much weight it could support while also
                                    needing to allow a golf ball to travel across it unimpeded. It's safe to say, we
                                    aced it as pictured to the right. In fact we did so well they ran out of weights to
                                    test our bridge and ended up needing to go to the gym on campus to get more. We
                                    ended up doing the best by a long margin, which probably upset quite a few of the
                                    engineering students, seeing a bunch of computer nerds one up them in an engineering
                                    task.

                                    With my performance in the bridging course, I ended up getting into Ulster
                                    University. I learned a lot there, from python and java to embedded systems and
                                    mobile app development to name
                                    only a few. I even participated in a Hackathon where our team came third, which for
                                    whatever reason had a better prize than second. If you want to know more, check out

                                    I met some of my closest friends at University, and performed well, averaging a
                                    first in all but 2 modules across all 4 years. I'm thankful for Ulster University
                                    for
                                    taking a chance on me, and I'm glad I didn't let it go to waste. Through them I
                                    landed
                                    a placement opportunity at Stryker Belfast, making the code behind some of their
                                    testing systems for their defibrillators. I ended up working there for 4 years,
                                    before eventually leaving and landing a role at Graham's where I work as a Systems
                                    Analyst on many of their current web apps.

                                    I still love computers and technology in general, having now made more games and
                                    apps, worked on Raspberry PI's, repairing old consoles and fixing controllers with
                                    all that I have learned.
                                </p>

                                    Speaking of old consoles, one of my biggest hobbies I haven't yet mentioned is retro
                                    games. I've been collecting and repairing old consoles for ages now, and have
                                    amassed quite the collection. I'm also a huge Lord of the Rings fan, and love all
                                    things fantasy. I'm effectively your stereotypical nerd, having played my fair share
                                    of D&D, Magic the gathering, etc.
